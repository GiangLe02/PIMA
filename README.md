# Project IMA: Stochastic interpolants for Image Generation

Contributors: Nesrine Naaman, Le Nguyen Huong Giang

Supervisor: Anastase Charantonis

In this project, we learned about state-of-the-art generative models and implemented them with the MNIST dataset.

## Models we have worked on
- Diffusion
- Flow Matching
- Conditional Diffusion
- Conditional Flow Matching
  
Each model implementation is in its own folder. All of the models were implemented on Google Colaboratory.
