# Project IMA: Stochastic interpolants for image generative

Contributor: Nesrine Naaman, Le Nguyen Huong Giang

Supervisor: Anastase Charantonis

In this project, we study about the generative models and implement it with the MNIST dataset.

## Models we have worked on
- Diffusion
- Flow Matching
- Conditional Diffusion
- Conditional Flow Matching
  
Each model implementation is on its own folder. All of the models are implemented in Google Colaborator.
